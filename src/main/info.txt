	Hi! Thanks for using this program! Here, we'll go over how to use this program as well as a little bit on how this works. If you need anything else, see the "About" section.
	In short, this program is called LANShare, and it allows you to share files over your local area network. A local network is any network that connects devices in a small area. For most people, the network consists of all of the devices in their home. If sharing files over the internet sounds scary, don't worry! Pretty much all modern routers have built-in firewalls which prevent people outside the network from seeing anything that goes on within unless you give them permission. 
	Now let's go over how to use this. 
	First, someone launches this program on two or more different computers connected to the same network. If you're using Wi-Fi, the network names should be the same. Then, the person who wants to send the file clicks on the send button, then clicks on the file chooser button to select a file. 
	After that's done, everyone who wants to receive the file must click on the "Check for other devices" button. That button broadcasts a message on the router so that every other computer running the program can see that it's available to receive files. Due to the way networks are designed, this doesn't always work the first time, so you may need to click on the button more than once. 
	Then, the sending computer should see buttons appear on-screen with the names of the computers that want to receive the file. Again, if this doesn't happen, click on the "Check for other devices" button again. 
	Finally, the sending user can click on the button with the name of the receiving computer. The receiving computer should see a dialog pop up asking whether they want to receive the file. If it's the right file, you should click yes. A new dialog with a progress bar should appear. Once it finishes, it'll tell you where you can find the file. 
	That's it!
	Here are some of the technical details behind this program. Most people don't need to read this section, though, but it can be helpful if you have enough background knowledge. 
	The "Check for other devices" button sends a UDP broadcast signal to the router with a "hello" message. The router then attempts to send this broadcast is sent to all other devices in the network, although occasionally packets are dropped. If another device running this program successfully receives the message, it'll check if it's the first time it's come in contact with the device. If so, it'll send a signal back telling the receiving device that it got the message successfully. Both programs store each other's IP addresses, which are used to send data between two specific devices. 
	When someone clicks on a device to send a file to on the sending side, both computers establish a TCP connection. Then, the sending machine reads the binary data of the file, sends it over the network, and the receiving machine writes it to a file of its own. If that file already exists, it'll write it to another file with a number at the end. 
	Finally, when everything is complete, the devices will disconnect.
