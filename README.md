During COVID, the internet got completely clogged up, and we didn't have enough bandwidth for everyone to do video calls and play games and stream on YouTube and do all the different things people usually do on the internet. So, while I was trying to transfer some really large flies from one computer to another using Google Drive, I thought -- why waste our precious bandwidth on uploaidng and then downloading the same file, when we could just skip all of that and transfer it directly over the local network?

Enter, LANShare:

Local area network file sharing program LANShare, using UDP broadcasting and TCP. Written in JavaFX (& rewritten in Qt, although not in this repo)

## Mac commands:
Run the following command, replacing `/path/to/application.app` with the actual path to the downloaded application file: `xattr -cr /path/to/application.app`
