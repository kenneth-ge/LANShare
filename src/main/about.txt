Hi! I'm Kenneth Ge, the creator of this program. You can find me at kennethkouge@gmail.com. 
So here's the premise: you have a large file, let's say it's at least 250MB. You need to get it from one computer to another. It can be a large document, some photos or videos, a program, or something else. You try looking for a USB flash drive -- but you can't one. You try emailing it to yourself, but everyone else is quarantined and on video calls, so your internet's really slow. You try finding a USB drive, and you do! You transfer the files onto the drive, bring it over to your other computer, and -- it's an ultra-thin-and-light, so it only has USB-C. 
Luckily, LANShare is here to help! With LANShare, you can transfer files quickly over your local internet! Since all of the traffic is contained within your home network, it's super fast, secure, and private -- no more giving Google or Yahoo your passport or home contract. It works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and all you need is an internet connection! It's super light-weight and can run on virtually any modern computer. 
It's easy! Why not give it a try?
